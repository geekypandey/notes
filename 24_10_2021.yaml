      Since I wanted to write about my daily learnings in yaml format, thought it would be best to learn the basics of yaml first :-) 
      I have been using yaml in Github Actions, but never got around learning it.
      I stole this: `alias yamlcheck='python -c "import sys, yaml as y; y.safe_load(open(sys.argv[1]))"'` from https://github.com/nibalizer/bash-tricks/blob/master/bash_tricks.sh.
      Easy yaml checking in the terminal.
